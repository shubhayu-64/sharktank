# SharkTank

This is a parody project where the plan is to make a bot called shark invest into some stocks, 
crypto and trade on it using ML and basic algorithms. All trades will be on paper and no real trades will be made. 

There will be two major parts called the Shark and the Tank. The Shark will be the bot that will invest in stocks
and the Tank will be responsible for all trades and management. It will also hold the liquidity pool and the
stocks in the portfolio.
